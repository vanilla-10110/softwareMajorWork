WELCOME TO SWORDS AND SPELLS!!!

You probably stole this game and didn't get it from wherever we published it but we dont care.

To open the game, first make sure your VR headset is on, then open the folder and double click on "major.exe". 
That is the game I promise it isn't a virus. Nothing will display on screen, but the game should be running in your VR headset.

f.a.q
Q:Why is this game so broken?
A:We made this game over the course of a year, but that doesn't mean we actually worked on it that entire time. We also had no idea how to make a VR game when we started.

Q:When is the sequel coming out?
A:We might remake the game to be not VR, but not for a while.

Q:What do the items do?
A:The horse shoe increases your speed, the bird skull increases your crit chance, and the yellow potion gives an explosion effect when damaging an enemy.

Q:Huh?
A: yeahh...

Q:Is it a risk of rain 2 clone?
A:Our game is too bad to be even considered similar to ror2.
